Loughborough University Final Year Project

To play the game, download "Hashi.zip", extract it and open the "Hashi.exe" file

Game rules:
•	Connect nodes by up to two bridges so that the total number of bridges touching any node is equal to the number on the node.
•	Do this for all nodes.
•	The player wins when all nodes have the correct number of bridges, and they are all joined together (there must be
a path from each node to all other nodes).
•	Bridges can only be placed vertically or horizontally (not diagonally).
•	Bridges cannot cross over each other.
